	While writing my thesis, and choosing latex for numerous reasons, I found that the supplied template from the library is really made for and by the school of Computer Science. Furthermore, there are a couple of small details in the supplied template that are not quite what I wanted. So this set of files is a modified version of the original CS/library template that includes more favourable contents for a thesis written in BPK.
